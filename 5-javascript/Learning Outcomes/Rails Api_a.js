RAILS APIs
//How does Rails know which type of file you are expecting back when you make an HTTP request?
// Checks the requests, if it is AJAX => request.xhr?



//What is the purpose of the #respond_to method?
// To allocate respond across variable requests



//How do you return a User object but specify that you don’t want to include certain attributes (i.e. you can’t just return User.first)?




//What are the two steps performed behind the scenes by the #to_json method?




//How do you tell a controller action to render nothing but an error message?




//How do you build your own custom error messages?




//Why can’t you use session-based controller authentication methods if you want people to access your API programmatically?




//What is “Service Oriented Architecture?”
