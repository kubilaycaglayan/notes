const name = "Maynard"
const color = "red"
const number = 34
const food = "rice"

// logging all of these variables might be a useful thing to do,
// but doing it like this can be somewhat confusing.
console.log(name, color, number, food) // Maynard red 34 rice

// if you simply turn them into an object with brackets,
// the output is much easier to decipher:
console.log({name, color, number, food})
 // { name: 'Maynard', color: 'red', number: 34, food: 'rice' }
